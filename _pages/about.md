This course aims to bring together different disciplines of computer vision, includin Visual Recogntion, Multi-View Reconstruction, and recent topics such as Neural Fields, Representation Learning, Generative AI etc. We want to show how embodied agents learn to see and sense our physical environments. 

<Strong>Prerequisite knowledge</Strong>
- Linear algebra and calculus
- Probability 
- Basic computer vision algorithms
- Machine learning and recent deep learning approaches
- Python and PyTorch

<Strong>Course Goals</Strong>

- Understand and implement classical computer vision algorithms.
- Understand and implement deep learning-based visual recognition and reconstruction algorithms. 
- Try out extensions of recent papers. 

<Strong>Grading</Strong>

- 3 homework assignments (15% each)
- 1 paper presentation (15%)
- 1 course project (5% project proposal, 10% midterm report, 10% final presentation, 10% final report)
- Class participation (5%)
- 5 grace days in total that may be applied to homework assignments or the course project. No more than 3 grace days can be used on a single assignment or the course project.

<Strong>Collaboration</Strong>

(Adapted from Roni Rosenfeld’s Course Policies.)

- Students are encouraged to study materials in groups and are allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular homework problem. The actual solution must be done by each student alone.
- Students are expected to form a group of three to finish the course project and to evenly distribute the workload.
